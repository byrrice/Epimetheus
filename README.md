### Overview Summary: 
Overview is a software application designed to be run on a fleet of drones scouting disaster areas. Our application marks obstructions it detects by taking snapshots of the area and comparing it to a regular snapshot of the area and filtering it to find the biggest pixel differences. It will run live with virtually no downtime using DFS, broadcasting which roads are blocked off in the disaster area.
